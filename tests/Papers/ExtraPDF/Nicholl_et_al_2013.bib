 abstract = "{Super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10$^{44}$ ergs
per second at their peak luminosity have recently been discovered in
faint galaxies at redshifts of 0.1-4. Some evolve slowly, resembling
models of `pair-instability' supernovae. Such models involve stars with
original masses 140-260 times that of the Sun that now have
carbon-oxygen cores of 65-130 solar masses. In these stars, the photons
that prevent gravitational collapse are converted to electron-positron
pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclear explosions. Many
solar masses of $^{56}$Ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to
$^{56}$Fe via $^{56}$Co, powering bright light curves. Such
massive progenitors are expected to have formed from metal-poor gas in
the early Universe. Recently, supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift
0.127 (about 12 billion years after the Big Bang) with a metallicity
one-third that of the Sun was observed to look like a fading
pair-instability supernova. Here we report observations of two
slow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise
times and blue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability
models. Their late-time light-curve and spectral similarities to
supernova 2007bi call the nature of that event into question. Our early
spectra closely resemble typical fast-declining super-luminous
supernovae, which are not powered by radioactivity. Modelling our
observations with 10-16 solar masses of magnetar-energized ejecta
demonstrates the possibility of a common explosion mechanism. The lack
of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests that their local
rate of occurrence is less than 6{\times}10$^{-6}$ times that of
the core-collapse rate.
