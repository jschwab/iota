 abstract = "{The merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) creates a differentially rotating
remnant which is unstable to magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. These
instabilities can lead to viscous evolution on a time-scale short
compared to the thermal evolution of the remnant. We present
multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of WD merger
remnants under the action of an {$\alpha$}-viscosity. We initialize our
calculations using the output of eight WD merger simulations from Dan et
al., which span a range of mass ratios and total masses. We generically
find that the merger remnants evolve towards spherical states on
time-scales of hours, even though a significant fraction of the mass is
initially rotationally supported. The viscous evolution unbinds only a
very small amount of mass ({\lsim}10-5 M). Viscous heating causes some of
the systems we study with He WD secondaries to reach conditions of
nearly-dynamical burning. It is thus possible that the post-merger
viscous phase triggers detonation of the He envelope in some WD mergers,
potentially producing a Type Ia supernova via a double-detonation
scenario. Our calculations provide the proper initial conditions for
studying the long-term thermal evolution of WD merger remnants. This is
important for understanding WD mergers as progenitors of Type Ia
supernovae, neutron stars, R Coronae Borealis stars and other phenomena.
