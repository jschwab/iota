 abstract = "{Galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses with measured stellar velocity
dispersions allow a test of the weak-field metric on kiloparsec scales
and a geometric measurement of the cosmological distance-redshift
relation, provided that the mass-dynamical structure of the lensing
galaxies can be independently constrained to a sufficient degree. We
combine data on 53 galaxy-scale strong lenses from the Sloan Lens ACS
Survey with a well-motivated fiducial set of lens-galaxy parameters to
find (1) a constraint on the post-Newtonian parameter {$\gamma$} = 1.01
{\plusmn} 0.05, and (2) a determination of {$\Omega$}$_{Λ}$ =
0.75 {\plusmn} 0.17 under the assumption of a flat universe. These
constraints assume that the underlying observations and priors are free
of systematic error. We evaluate the sensitivity of these results to
systematic uncertainties in (1) total mass-profile shape, (2) velocity
anisotropy, (3) light-profile shape, and (4) stellar velocity
dispersion. Based on these sensitivities, we conclude that while such
strong-lens samples can, in principle, provide an important tool for
testing general relativity and cosmology, they are unlikely to yield
precision measurements of {$\gamma$} and {$\Omega$}$_{Λ}$ unless
the properties of the lensing galaxies are independently constrained
with substantially greater accuracy than at present.

Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope,
obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by
AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are
associated with programs No. 10174, No. 10494, No. 10587, No. 10798, and
No. 10886.
