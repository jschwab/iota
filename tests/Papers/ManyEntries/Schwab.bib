 abstract = "{The merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) creates a differentially rotating
remnant which is unstable to magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. These
instabilities can lead to viscous evolution on a time-scale short
compared to the thermal evolution of the remnant. We present
multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of WD merger
remnants under the action of an {$\alpha$}-viscosity. We initialize our
calculations using the output of eight WD merger simulations from Dan et
al., which span a range of mass ratios and total masses. We generically
find that the merger remnants evolve towards spherical states on
time-scales of hours, even though a significant fraction of the mass is
initially rotationally supported. The viscous evolution unbinds only a
very small amount of mass ({\lsim}10-5 M). Viscous heating causes some of
the systems we study with He WD secondaries to reach conditions of
nearly-dynamical burning. It is thus possible that the post-merger
viscous phase triggers detonation of the He envelope in some WD mergers,
potentially producing a Type Ia supernova via a double-detonation
scenario. Our calculations provide the proper initial conditions for
studying the long-term thermal evolution of WD merger remnants. This is
important for understanding WD mergers as progenitors of Type Ia
supernovae, neutron stars, R Coronae Borealis stars and other phenomena.

 abstract = "{We use a collection of 14 well-measured neutron-star masses to
strengthen the case that a substantial fraction of these neutron stars
were formed via electron-capture (e-capture) supernovae (SNe) as opposed
to Fe core-collapse SNe. The e-capture SNe are characterized by lower
resultant gravitational masses and smaller natal kicks, leading to lower
orbital eccentricities when the e-capture SN has led to the formation of
the second neutron star in a binary system. Based on the measured masses
and eccentricities, we identify four neutron stars, which have a mean
post-collapse gravitational mass of \~{}1.25 M $_{sun}$, as the
product of e-capture SNe. We associate the remaining 10 neutron stars,
which have a mean mass of \~{}1.35 M $_{sun}$, with Fe core-collapse
SNe. If the e-capture SN occurs during the formation of the first
neutron star, then this should substantially increase the formation
probability for double neutron stars, given that more systems will
remain bound with the smaller kicks. However, this does not appear to be
the case for any of the observed systems and we discuss possible reasons
for this.

dispersions allow a test of the weak-field metric on kiloparsec scales

relation, provided that the mass-dynamical structure of the lensing
galaxies can be independently constrained to a sufficient degree. We
combine data on 53 galaxy-scale strong lenses from the Sloan Lens ACS
Survey with a well-motivated fiducial set of lens-galaxy parameters to
find (1) a constraint on the post-Newtonian parameter {$\gamma$} = 1.01
{\plusmn} 0.05, and (2) a determination of {$\Omega$}$_{Λ}$ =
0.75 {\plusmn} 0.17 under the assumption of a flat universe. These
constraints assume that the underlying observations and priors are free
of systematic error. We evaluate the sensitivity of these results to
systematic uncertainties in (1) total mass-profile shape, (2) velocity
anisotropy, (3) light-profile shape, and (4) stellar velocity
dispersion. Based on these sensitivities, we conclude that while such
strong-lens samples can, in principle, provide an important tool for
testing general relativity and cosmology, they are unlikely to yield
precision measurements of {$\gamma$} and {$\Omega$}$_{Λ}$ unless
the properties of the lensing galaxies are independently constrained
with substantially greater accuracy than at present.
